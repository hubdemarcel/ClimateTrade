# Meteostat Historical Weather Data Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of Meteostat Python library into the climatetrade project, providing comprehensive historical weather data worldwide for enhanced weather-market correlation analysis and backtesting capabilities.

## Background

The climatetrade project previously relied on real-time weather data sources (Met Office for UK, NWS for US, Weather2Geo for global). While effective for current conditions and short-term forecasting, these sources lacked extensive historical data necessary for robust backtesting of weather-market correlations. The Meteostat integration addresses this gap by providing access to decades of historical weather data globally.

## Data Sources Comparison

### Existing Weather Data Sources

#### Met Office Weather DataHub

- **Type**: Official UK Government meteorological service
- **Coverage**: UK-wide with high resolution for London area
- **Update Frequency**: Hourly forecasts with detailed parameters
- **Data Quality**: Authoritative, government-backed meteorological data
- **Limitations**: Primarily UK-focused, limited historical depth for backtesting

#### National Weather Service (NWS)

- **Type**: Official US Government weather service
- **Coverage**: US-wide with detailed regional forecasts
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time observations and forecasts
- **Data Quality**: Authoritative US meteorological data
- **Limitations**: US-focused, limited global coverage

#### Weather2Geo (MSN Weather API)

- **Type**: Commercial weather API (MSN/Microsoft)
- **Coverage**: Global, with focus on major cities
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time current conditions
- **Data Quality**: Geolocation-based, widget-sourced
- **Limitations**: Limited historical data, commercial API dependencies

### New Meteostat Integration

#### Meteostat Python Library

- **Type**: Open-source meteorological data library
- **Coverage**: Global weather station network (30,000+ stations worldwide)
- **Update Frequency**: Historical data from 1970+ with daily/hourly resolution
- **Data Quality**: Quality-controlled meteorological observations
- **API Access**: Free, no API key required
- **Data Types**: Historical observations, climate normals, weather station metadata

## Integration Architecture

### 3. Enhanced Backtesting Framework

#### Historical Correlation Analysis

```python
from meteostat import Point, Daily
from datetime import datetime

# Get 10 years of historical data for analysis
start = datetime(2014, 1, 1)
end = datetime(2023, 12, 31)

nyc = Point(40.7128, -74.0060, 10)
data = Daily(nyc, start, end).fetch()

# Analyze weather-market correlations
correlation_matrix = analyze_weather_market_correlation(data, market_data)
```

#### Multi-Decadal Trend Analysis

- **Climate Change Impact**: Long-term weather pattern analysis
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Historical seasonal weather behavior
- **Extreme Event Frequency**: Analysis of rare weather events
- **Risk Assessment**: Enhanced portfolio risk modeling

### 4. Flexible Data Access Patterns

**Point-Based Access:**

```python
# Any geographic location
location = Point(latitude, longitude, elevation)
data = Daily(location, start_date, end_date).fetch()
```

**Station-Based Access:**

```python
# Specific weather station
stations = Stations()
station = stations.fetch().iloc[0]  # Get nearest station
data = Daily(station, start_date, end_date).fetch()
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Historical Data Retrieval

```bash
# Run NYC historical weather example
python scripts/example_meteostat_nyc.py

# Run London historical weather example
python scripts/example_meteostat_london.py
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from meteostat import Point, Daily
from datetime import datetime

# Get NYC weather data for 2020-2023
nyc = Point(40.7128, -74.0060, 10)
start = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
end = datetime(2023, 12, 31)

data = Daily(nyc, start, end).fetch()

# Available parameters
print(data.columns)
# Index(['tavg', 'tmin', 'tmax', 'prcp', 'snow', 'wdir', 'wspd', 'wpgt', 'pres', 'tsun']

# Temperature analysis
print(data[['tavg', 'tmin', 'tmax']].describe())
```

### Advanced Analysis Integration

```python
import pandas as pd
from meteostat import Point, Daily

class HistoricalWeatherAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weather_cache = {}

    def get_historical_weather(self, city, start_date, end_date):
        """Get historical weather data for backtesting"""
        if city == 'NYC':
            location = Point(40.7128, -74.0060, 10)
        elif city == 'London':
            location = Point(51.5074, -0.1278, 11)

        data = Daily(location, start_date, end_date).fetch()
        return self.process_weather_data(data)

    def analyze_market_correlation(self, weather_data, market_data):
        """Analyze weather-market correlations using historical data"""
        # Implementation for correlation analysis
