# Met Office Weather DataHub Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the official UK Met Office Weather DataHub utilities into the climatetrade project, providing enhanced weather data capabilities for London weather patterns and comprehensive weather-market correlation analysis.

## Background

The climatetrade project previously relied on Weather2Geo (using MSN Weather API) for weather data. While effective for geolocation-based weather matching, this integration adds official UK government weather data from the Met Office, providing authoritative meteorological information specifically valuable for UK markets and London-based analysis.

## Data Sources Comparison

### Existing Weather Data Sources

#### Weather2Geo (MSN Weather API)

- **Type**: Commercial weather API (MSN/Microsoft)
- **Coverage**: Global, with focus on major cities
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time current conditions
- **Data Quality**: Geolocation-based, widget-sourced
- **Use Case**: OSINT-style weather matching and geolocation
- **Limitations**: Limited historical data, commercial API dependencies

#### Weather Underground (Not Currently Implemented)

- **Status**: Referenced in requirements but not yet integrated
- **Type**: Crowdsourced weather network
- **Coverage**: Global with dense station network
- **Strengths**: High spatial resolution, community-driven data
- **Note**: Could be added as a complementary data source in the future

### New Met Office Integration

#### Met Office Weather DataHub

- **Type**: Official UK Government meteorological service
- **Coverage**: UK-wide with high resolution for London area
- **Update Frequency**: Hourly forecasts with detailed parameters
- **Data Quality**: Authoritative, government-backed meteorological data
- **API Access**: Requires API key from Met Office Weather DataHub
- **Data Types**: Site-specific forecasts, atmospheric data, map images

## Integration Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Met Office Client (`met_office_london_weather.py`)

A Python client that wraps the Met Office Weather DataHub site-specific API:

```python
from met_office_london_weather import MetOfficeWeatherClient

client = MetOfficeWeatherClient("your_api_key")
current = client.get_current_conditions()
hourly = client.get_hourly_forecast(24)
daily = client.get_daily_forecast(5)
```

**Key Features:**

- Current weather conditions for London
- Hourly forecasts (up to 48 hours)
- Daily forecasts (up to 5 days)
- Comprehensive meteorological parameters
- Error handling and retries
- JSON and formatted output options

#### 2. Integration Example (`example_met_office_integration.py`)

Demonstrates combining Met Office data with existing sources:

```python
from example_met_office_integration import WeatherMarketAnalyzer

analyzer = WeatherMarketAnalyzer("met_office_api_key")
report = analyzer.get_comprehensive_weather_report()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_weather_market_impacts(report)
```

**Capabilities:**

- Multi-source weather data aggregation
- Automated market impact analysis
- Weather event detection
- Trading recommendations based on weather patterns

#### 3. Requirements (`requirements-met-office.txt`)

- `requests>=2.25.0` - HTTP client for API calls

## Enhanced Capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Market Correlation Analysis

#### Temperature-Based Analysis

```python
# Extreme temperatures impact energy markets
if temperature < 5:
    # Cold weather alert
    impacts.append("Heating costs impact on energy markets")
elif temperature > 25:
    # Hot weather alert
    impacts.append("Cooling costs and drought concerns")
```

#### Precipitation Analysis

```python
# Heavy rain affects multiple sectors
if precipitation > 10:
    impacts.append("Potential flooding impacts on property markets")
```

#### Wind Analysis

```python
# Strong winds disrupt transportation
if wind_speed > 20:
    impacts.append("Potential disruption to transportation and supply chains")
```

### 4. Multi-Temporal Forecasting

**Hourly Forecasts:**

- 48-hour detailed predictions
- Useful for short-term trading decisions
- High-frequency weather pattern analysis

**Daily Forecasts:**

- 5-day outlook
- Strategic market positioning
- Extended weather trend analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic London Weather Retrieval

```bash
# Get current London weather
python met_office_london_weather.py --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --current
