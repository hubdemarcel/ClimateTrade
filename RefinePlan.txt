Refined Implementation Plan
I've updated the todo list to reflect the comprehensive project context:

✅ Analysis Phase Complete - Reviewed architecture, database schema, and documentation standards
🔄 Data Migration Script - Import existing CSV files into polymarket_data table
📁 File Rotation System - Keep last 30 days, archive by event type
🗂️ Directory Restructuring - Organize data folders by date and event type
🔄 Dashboard Migration - Switch MarketDashboard from CSV to database queries
🌤️ Official Data Integration - Add weather_data table with verification rules
📊 Comparison Dashboard - Visual comparison of scrapped vs official data
🎯 Gap Analysis - Highlight differences and missing data points
🔧 Pipeline Updates - Default to database storage for new data
✅ Data Quality Validation - Ensure integrity of migrated and new data
📚 Documentation Updates - Update docs to reflect new architecture

Key Architectural Considerations
Database-First Approach: Aligns with existing SQLite schema and comprehensive data model
Data Quality Framework: Built-in validation and quality scoring system
Modular Design: Clean separation between weather data, market data, and trading logic
Documentation Standards: Changes require corresponding documentation updates
Next Steps
Are you pleased with this refined plan that incorporates the full project context? If so, I can switch to the appropriate mode to begin implementation with the data migration script. If you'd like any modifications to the approach or priorities, let me know.
